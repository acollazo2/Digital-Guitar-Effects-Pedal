% IIR coefficents for a first order high pass filter.
% cutoff_freq: cut off frequency of high pass filter.
% sampling_freq: sampling frequency of system.
% b: coefficients for numerator of transfer function [b0, b1*z^-1, b2*bz^-2,...]
% a: coefficients for denominator of transfer function [a0, a1*z^-1, a2*z^-2,...]
function [b, a] = HP_FirstOrder_Coeff(cutoff_freq, sampling_freq)
